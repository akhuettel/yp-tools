This is version 2.2 of a collection of NIS client tools.

See the file COPYING for copying restrictions.

This package contains ypcat, ypmatch, ypset, ypwhich, yppasswd,
domainname, nisdomainname and ypdomainname. It is a complete
rewrite of the old yp-tools 1.4.x package. It fixes a lot of bugs
and problems with the old version.

This package should work with every Linux libc 5 and glibc 2,
and is a replacement of the yp-clients 2.2 and yp-tools 1.4.x

This version contains locale support. German locales are included.

You could get the latest version from:

http://www-vt.uni-paderborn.de/~kukuk/linux/nis.html

or from the main ftp server:

ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/net/NIS/yp-tools-2.2.tar.gz

You should use ypbind 3.3 with the ypbind-3.3-glibc4.diff patch
from ftp.kernel.org or ypbind-mt 1.4 or greater.

Don't forget to edit /etc/nsswitch.conf, or install the version
from the etc directory for NIS.
