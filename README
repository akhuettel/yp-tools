This package contains ypcat, ypmatch, ypset, ypwhich, yppasswd,
domainname, nisdomainname and ypdomainname. It is a complete
rewrite of the old yp-tools 1.4.x package. It fixes a lot of bugs
and problems with the old version.

yp-tools 4.x has full NIS IPv6 support if compiled and linked against
libnsl >= 1.0.1 and libtirpc >= 1.0.1
